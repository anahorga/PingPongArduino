# Ping Pong on LEDs - Arduino  

This is a simple **Ping Pong game** built with an Arduino and a row of LEDs. A light moves across the LEDs like a ball, and you must **press a button** before it reaches the end to bounce it back. If you miss, your opponent scores a point!  

Fun and easy to play, perfect for testing your reflexes!"
